## Connecting the AI tools to Ollama

The Tone Adjuster and Meeting Prep Assistant can call a locally running [Ollama](https://ollama.ai) instance for live rewrites and briefings.

1. **Allow browser access** by launching Ollama with the following command (paste it straight into your terminal):

   ```bash
   OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0:11434 OLLAMA_ORIGINS="https://doyouknowmarc.github.io"
   ollama serve
   ```

   Swap the origin for your local dev URL (for example `http://localhost:5173`) if you are running the app from another host. You can also make the change permanent by adding the values to `~/.ollama/config`:

   ```toml
   [server]
   listen = "0.0.0.0:11434"
   origins = [
     "http://localhost:5173",
     "http://127.0.0.1:5173"
   ]
   ```

   Restart Ollama after updating the configuration file.

3. **Verify the API is reachable**:

   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags
   ```

   The response should list the available models.

4. **Load models inside the app** by entering the base URL (for example `http://localhost:11434`) in the Tone Adjuster or Meeting Prep panels and clicking **Refresh models**. Once connected, choose a model and trigger the rewrite/drafting buttons to call Ollama.
